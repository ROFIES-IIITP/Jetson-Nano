# Collision Avoidance Project

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a **Collision Avoidance** system for robotics applications, specifically utilizing the JetBot platform. The system is designed to detect and avoid obstacles in real-time, ensuring safe navigation. This is particularly useful for autonomous robots, drones, and other mobile platforms.

## Features

- **Real-Time Obstacle Detection**: Utilizes sensors to continuously monitor the surroundings for potential obstacles.
- **Path Planning**: Calculates the safest path to avoid detected obstacles while maintaining the desired trajectory.
- **Scalability**: Adaptable to various robotic platforms with minimal modifications.
- **Jupyter Integration**: Easily accessible through the Jupyter environment for real-time coding, visualization, and testing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following hardware and software:

- **Hardware**:
  - JetBot or similar robotics platform
  - Sensors (e.g., LiDAR, ultrasonic sensors, or cameras)
  - NVIDIA Jetson Nano
  - Wireless network for accessing the JetBot

- **Software**:
  - Jupyter Notebook (accessible through the JetBot's IP address)
  - Python 3.x
  - Required Python libraries (e.g., OpenCV, NumPy, TensorFlow)

### Setup

1. **Connect to JetBot**:
   - Power up your JetBot and connect it to your wireless network.
   - Find the IP address of your JetBot and access the Jupyter environment by navigating to `http://<JetBot-IP-Address>:8888` in your web browser.

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Ensure all necessary Python libraries are installed. You can use the provided `requirements.txt` to install dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Run the Collision Avoidance Notebook**:
   - Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory and open the `collision_avoidance.ipynb` notebook.
   - Follow the instructions within the notebook to set up and run the collision avoidance system.

## Usage

- Launch the Jupyter environment and open the `collision_avoidance.ipynb` notebook.
- Follow the steps to initialize the sensors and start the collision avoidance process.
- Monitor the outputs and tweak the parameters as needed to optimize performance.
